##### My progress report
1. I cloned the repo, and used version control to open it in RStudio.  I edited the README, and the RMarkdown files in RStudio, using save/commit/push to update in GitHub.

2. OVerall, it was pretty easy as I have coded in R, and used GitHub before.  I used the Markdown Cheatsheet for some help with syntax.
